# Purdue Brightspace MCP Server

Access your Purdue Brightspace courses using natural language. Get grades, due dates, announcements, rosters, and more. Works with any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

## What You Can Do

- "What assignments are due this week?"
- "Show my grades for CS 252"
- "What announcements did my professors post today?"
- "Who is the instructor for MATH 266?"
- "Download the lecture slides from Module 3"
- "What's my grade in all my classes?"
- "Get me the roster emails for my CS course"

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
   - Download from https://nodejs.org/ (choose the LTS version)
   - To check if you already have it: Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type `node --version`

2. **An MCP client** (any of these work)
   - [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
   - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
   - [ChatGPT Desktop](https://openai.com/chatgpt/desktop/)
   - [Cursor](https://cursor.com)
   - Or any other app that supports MCP

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone this repository

Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/purdue-brightspace-mcp.git
cd purdue-brightspace-mcp
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will take about 1-2 minutes. It will also automatically install Chromium (used for authentication).

### Step 3: Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript code. It should complete in a few seconds.

### Step 4: Authenticate with Brightspace

```bash
npm run auth
```

**What happens:**
1. A browser window will open
2. Log in with your Purdue credentials (username@purdue.edu)
3. Approve the Duo push notification on your phone
4. The browser will close automatically once authenticated

**Note:** You only need to do this once. The session lasts about 1 hour. When it expires, just run `npm run auth` again.

### Step 5: Configure your MCP client

The setup below uses Claude Desktop as an example, but this server works with any MCP client.

**Claude Desktop config file location:**
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Open it in a text editor and add this configuration (if the file doesn't exist, create it):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "purdue-brightspace": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/purdue-brightspace-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `/absolute/path/to/purdue-brightspace-mcp` with the actual path on your computer.

To find the path:
- **Mac/Linux**: In Terminal, go to the project directory and run `pwd`
- **Windows**: In Command Prompt, go to the project directory and run `cd`

**Example (Mac):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "purdue-brightspace": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/username/purdue-brightspace-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example (Windows):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "purdue-brightspace": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\username\\purdue-brightspace-mcp\\build\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file and **restart your MCP client completely** (quit and reopen).

### Step 6: Verify it works

1. Open your MCP client
2. Start a new conversation
3. Try asking: **"What are my courses?"**

If it works, you'll see a list of your Brightspace courses!

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `check_auth` | Check if you're logged in to Brightspace |
| `get_my_courses` | Get all your enrolled courses |
| `get_upcoming_due_dates` | Get assignments and quizzes due soon |
| `get_my_grades` | Get your grades for one or all courses |
| `get_announcements` | Get course announcements |
| `get_assignments` | Get detailed assignment and quiz information |
| `get_course_content` | Browse course content (modules, files, links) |
| `download_file` | Download course files or submission attachments |
| `get_classlist_emails` | Get email addresses for instructors and TAs |
| `get_roster` | Get course roster (instructors, TAs, optionally students) |

## Advanced Configuration

### Filter courses

If you have a lot of courses and want to hide some, you can add course filters to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "purdue-brightspace": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/purdue-brightspace-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "D2L_INCLUDE_COURSES": "123456,789012",
        "D2L_EXCLUDE_COURSES": "111111,222222",
        "D2L_ACTIVE_ONLY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Options:**
- `D2L_INCLUDE_COURSES`: Only show these course IDs (comma-separated). Overrides other filters.
- `D2L_EXCLUDE_COURSES`: Hide these course IDs (comma-separated).
- `D2L_ACTIVE_ONLY`: Set to `"false"` to show inactive courses (default: `"true"`).

**How to find course IDs:**
Ask "What are my courses?" and the tool will show the IDs.

### Re-authenticate

Your Brightspace session expires after about 1 hour. When it does, the server will report "Not authenticated."

To log in again:
```bash
npm run auth
```

You don't need to restart your MCP client after re-authenticating.

## Troubleshooting

**"Not authenticated" error**
- **Solution**: Run `npm run auth` in the project directory. The browser will open and you'll log in again.

**MCP client doesn't respond to Brightspace queries**
- **Solution 1**: Restart your MCP client completely (quit and reopen, not just close the window).
- **Solution 2**: Check that the path in your MCP config is correct and points to `build/index.js`.
- **Solution 3**: Make sure you ran `npm run build` after any code changes.

**Browser doesn't open during authentication**
- **Solution**: Make sure you have a default browser set. Try running `npm run auth` again. If it still doesn't work, check that Chromium was installed correctly with `npx playwright install chromium`.

## Security

- Your Purdue credentials are never stored in this repository or in the code.
- Session tokens are encrypted using AES-256-GCM and stored in `~/.d2l-session/` (outside this project).
- Token files have restricted permissions (only your user account can read them).
- Tokens expire after about 1 hour for security.
- All communication with Brightspace uses HTTPS.
